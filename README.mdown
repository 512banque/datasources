# Array Datasource

Array Datasource is a datasource to CakePHP that you can use static content as model and interact
with your models that use DBO.

Exemple: CakePHP dont support enumerations, but with this datasource you can put your values and
texts in a model and associate (belongsTo / hasMany / ...). Also, you can generate a list of
states in a model, avoiding create a table or write various selects with this.
